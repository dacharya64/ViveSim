# ViveSim
A simulation based on experiment trials (ViveGame)

## About the project
This users Unity to create a 3D simulation of the data from [ViveGame](https://github.com/dacharya64/ViveGame), an experiment about VR navigation interfaces and their effects on spatial updating.

It takes a CSV file of data and creates a visual demo of each trial, showing the triangle path that the user was supposed to follow and the user's response. It also notes participant number, environment type, and nav interface used. 

## How to use
Download the project and open it up in Unity (developed in 5.6.1) OR open the .EXE. 

Controls are WASD to move, Q and E to move up / down, and R or arrow keys to rotate. Space bar changes the scene to the next trial.
